# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
**This project focused on the use of Pivot Tables and the COUNTIFS() function to categorize large sums of data.** All data for this project came from a pre-entered accounting sheet for fundraising campaigns specifying their id; name, blurb (project description), monetary goal (goal), money pledged (pledge), outcomes, country, currency, deadline and launch data(in duodecimals format), staff pick, number of backers  (backers count), category and subcategory, percentage funded, and average donation.

### Purpose
The first goal of this project was to create a chart and graph to demonstrate campaign outcomes based on launch date. The second goal of this project was to create a chart to demonstrate outcomes based on goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges
The first goal of the project is referred to as the Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date and the second goal of the project is referred to as the Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals. These goals will be discussed in the former order with PivotTables being the main focus of the first project and COUNTIFS() being the main focus of the second project.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Utilizing PivotTables one can create a sortable table and chart best on a selected excel sheet.
First the desired sheet was selected and highlighted (in this case it was our Kickstarter sheet). Then in the insert tab PivotChart was selected with the option PivotChart & PivotTable and placing the PivotTable in a new worksheet. 

A new sheet opened up with the PivotTable and options pop-up to the right hand of the screen called PivotTable Fields. In this area a list of column categories was shown at the top of the screen. Here the different categories were dragged and dropped into four sections filters, columns, rows, and values. It is important to note that values will create a count of whatever category is dragged and dropped into this section. 

The PivotTable was then filtered by theater in the parent category. Then by clicking the insert tab and the line graph icon (highlighted in red) a pop-up table with line graph options will appear. By selecting the option with points along the line graph, a graph with the data for the PivotTable appeared on the current sheet. 

This graph was then copy and pasted into paint and saved as a png. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
